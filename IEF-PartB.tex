Note that:

\item Any inter-relationship between different participating institutions or individuals (e.g. family ties, shared premises or facilities, joint ownership, financial interest, overlapping staff or directors, etc.) must be declared and justified in this part of the proposal;
\item The information in the table for non-academic beneficiaries must be based on current data, not projections;
\item The data provided relating to the capacity of the participating institutions will be subject to verification during the Grant Agreement preparation phase.
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\section{SUMMARY}
\label{sec:summary}

Please provide a short summary of the proposal, which could be the same as the proposal abstract, built around a research/innovation project.

\section{EXCELLENCE}
\label{sec:excellence}

Please note that the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers promoting open recruitment and attractive working conditions are expected to be endorsed and applied by all beneficiaries in the Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions.

\subsection{Quality, innovative aspects and credibility of the research}
\label{sec:quality}

You should develop your proposal according to the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction, state-of-the-art, objectives and overview of the action
\item Research methodology and approach: highlight the type of research and innovation activities proposed
\item Originality and innovative aspects of the research programme: explain the contribution that the project is expected to make to advancements within the project field. Describe any novel concepts, approaches or methods that will be employed.
\end{itemize}
The text should emphasise how the high-quality, novel research is the most likely to open up the best career possibilities for the Experienced Researcher and new collaboration opportunities for the host organisation(s). 

\subsection{Clarity and quality of transfer of knowledge/training for the development of the researcher in light of the research objectives}
\label{sec:transfer}

A two way transfer of knowledge should be described (please see Section 5.2 of this Guide):
\begin{itemize}
\item The text must show how the Experienced Researcher will gain new knowledge from the hosting organisation(s) during the fellowship through training. 
\item These organisations may also benefit from the previous experience of the researcher. Outline the capacity for transferring the knowledge previously acquired by the researcher to the host organisation(s).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quality of the supervision and the hosting arrangements}
\label{sec:supervision}

Required sub-heading:
\subsubsection*{Qualifications and experience of the supervisor(s)}

Information regarding the supervisor(s) must include the level of experience on the research topic proposed and document its track record of work, including the main international collaborations. Information provided should include participation in projects, publications, patents and any other relevant results.
To avoid duplication, the role and profile of the supervisor(s) should only be listed in the "Capacity of the Participating Organisations" tables (see section 6 below). 
The text must show that the Experienced Researcher should be well integrated within the hosting organisation(s) in order that all parties gain the maximum knowledge and skills from the fellowship. 
The following section of the European Charter for Researchers refers specifically to career development:

\paragraph{Career development}
Employers and/or funders of researchers should draw up, preferably within the framework of their human resources management, a specific career development strategy for researchers at all stages of their career, regardless of their contractual situation, including for researchers on fixed-term contracts. It should include the availability of mentors involved in providing support and guidance for the personal and professional development of researchers, thus motivating them and contributing to reducing any insecurity in their professional future. All researchers should be made familiar with such provisions and arrangements.

\subsection{Capacity of the researcher to reach and re-enforce a position of professional maturity in research}
\label{sec:maturity}

Please keep in mind that the fellowships will be awarded to the most talented researchers as shown by their ideas and their track record, where it is a fair indicator given their level of experience. 

\section{IMPACT}
\label{sec:impact}

\subsection{Enhancing research- and innovation-related human resources, skills, and working conditions to realise the potential of individuals and to provide new career perspectives}
\label{sec:enhancement}

In this section, please explain the impact of the research and training on the Experienced Researcher's career. The fellowship, including any secondments in Europe should maximise the impact on the researcher's activity on European society, including the science base and/or the economy, in a manner appropriate to the research field. 

\subsection{Effectiveness of the proposed measures for communication and results dissemination}

Required sub-headings: 

\subsubsection*{Communication and public engagement strategy of the action}
\subsubsection*{Dissemination of the research results}
\subsubsection*{Exploitation of results and intellectual property}

Concrete plans for the above must be included in the Gantt Chart. The new knowledge generated by the action should be used wherever possible to enhance the career of the researcher, to advance research, to foster innovation, and to promote the research profession to the public. 
The following sections of the European Charter for Researchers refer specifically to public engagement and dissemination:

\paragraph{Public engagement}
Researchers should ensure that their research activities are made known to society at large in such a way that they can be understood by non-specialists, thereby improving the public's understanding of science. Direct engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand public interest in priorities for science and technology and also the public's concerns. 

\paragraph{Dissemination, exploitation of results}
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settings or, if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are expected to take a lead in ensuring that research is fruitful and that results are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or both) whenever the opportunity arises. 


\section{IMPLEMENTATION}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{Overall coherence and effectiveness of the work plan}

The proposal should be designed in the optimal way to achieve the desired impact. A Gantt Chart should be included in the text where the following should be listed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Work Packages description; 
\item List of major deliverables;    
\item List of major milestones;  
\item Secondments if applicable.
\end{itemize}

The schedule should be in terms of number of months elapsed from the start of the project.

\subsection{Appropriateness of the management structure and procedures, including quality management and risk management}

Develop your proposal according to the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project organisation and management structure, including the financial management strategy, as well as the progress monitoring mechanisms put in place;
\item Risks that might endanger reaching project objectives and the contingency plans to be put in place should risk occur.
\end{itemize}
The following could be also included in the Gantt Chart:
\begin{itemize}
\item Progress monitoring;
\item Risk management;
\item Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
\end{itemize}
